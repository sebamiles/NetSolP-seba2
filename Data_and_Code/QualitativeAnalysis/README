This folder contains notebooks that were used to generate the qualitative plots. Tested in Google Colab.

After training the models using the Train_and_test.ipynb, change the location of the models appropriately in the following notebooks.

QualitativeAnalysis.ipynb:
Contains the code to generate attributions for sequences and save as a pickle file.
Utilize the saved attributions to make the importance vs length and the correlation with SWI plots.

ConservationVsImportance.ipynb:
Generate the attributions for sequences using the previous script and make the conservation vs importance plot.
Attributions for the three families from the training set used to make the plot in the paper are included in the folder Data.
